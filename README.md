## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python version 3

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose FIFA 20 complete player dataset. 

I am a sports fan and like playing with stats related to sports 

The questions that I am looking :

1. Which type of players costs more money for a team (Value) ? and which type of players earn the most (Wage)?
2. What are the top 5 features that influences the value and wage of a player ?
3. How are skills distributed among different category of players (Forward, Midfield and Defense) ? 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

players_20.csv contains lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, potential, wage, etc. 

Soccer_Stats.ipynb is a python notebook to showcsae all my work related to the questions.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The findings of analysis are available in this medium [blog](https://medium.com/@akshaykarthickm/sports-and-stats-soccer-through-the-eyes-of-a-statistician-e4bfb4db5d2b)
